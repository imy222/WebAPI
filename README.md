# Basic Web Application Kata
___
## About the Kata

---
This project is a standalone Joke API which maintains a list of Pokemon related jokes. 
This project is developed based on the requirements of the Phase 2 Basic Web Application Kata.
The objective of the Kata is to develop a REST API project that:

* Is well documented and uses industry standards
* Automatically tests and builds your project artefacts
* Automatically deploys your project into a production-ready environment
* Has security built-in

Full details of the Kata can be viewed at:</br>

## Accessing the deployed application

https://imay-webapi.svc.platform.myobdev.com/

## API 
### GET Requests
Using Postman or curl, making a GET request to https://imay-webapi.svc.platform.myobdev.com/joke path will return the collection of jokes, each with its own ID, question, punchline and category ID. 

A GET request to return a selected joke by ID can be made by appending the id number to the url above. </br>
For example https://imay-webapi.svc.platform.myobdev.com/joke/3 will return
```
{"id":3,"question":"What is the Dracula's favourite Pokemon?","punchline":"Koffin'"}
```
### POST Requests
To post a new joke, the Post endpoint can be reached by either using Postman or curl.
An example of a curl command would be:

>curl -X 'POST' \
'https://imay-webapi.svc.platform.myobdev.com/joke' \
-H 'accept: text/plain' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"Id" : 6,
"Question" : "What can Pikachu play with a baby?",
"Punchline" : "Pika-Boo!"}
'

### DELETE Requests

The DELETE endpoint takes in the ID number to indicate which joke to delete.
An example of a curl command to delete joke with ID no 6 would be:
```
curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'https://imay-webapi.svc.platform.myobdev.com/joke/6' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain'
```

### PUT Requests
The PUT endpoint takes in the ID number to indicate which joke to update.
An example of a curl command to update joke with ID no 4 would be:

```
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'https://imay-webapi.svc.platform.myobdev.com/joke/4' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "Id" : 4,
        "Question" : "What do you call Meowth's reflection?",
        "Punchline" : "TESTING"
}'
```


### Error Handling
Note that at this stage, error handling have not been implemented. This will be one of the next enhancements to this project. By deploying the project with a basic webapi, I hope to fully appreciate the benefits or CI/CD.
